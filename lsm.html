My heart knew a new beat and my soul hum a new song. My days has become brighter and my night more restful. Every day comes to me with a new side of love that is yet untold. You feature in all that I do. From the very first day, I knew I made a right choice. I knew this boat of love is heading towards a safe landing. I only wish I had met you earlier. I wonder how very sweet things would have been. Even now, I’m grateful you came my way. What would life had been without you! You’re my star and my sunshine. You brighten me at day and beautify my dream at night. You are the reason I wake up with fresh hopes. You are why my Joy knows no bound. Loving you is one habit I’m addicted to. And I will go deeper into it until I’m lost in you, my love. Giving you my all is a debt I owe and it’s obvious that I just can’t pay it all. I love you much more than you can ever comprehend. Yes, I love you.";
                var lsm2 = "I sat and looked back to how far we’ve come together. We have travelled a distance immeasurable and have plied mental paths that can’t be verbalized. I looked within my heart only to see how rhythmical it’s been beating… from the very first day it clung in love with yours – since I met you! You’ve been so amazing, than the best of descriptive Adjectives could help demonstrate. Your selfless acts of love has transformed the whole of me, beyond what I did envisage. Your love has brought out the best in me. I’ve hit a limelight! And I would have disagreed that love could give this much until you came into my life and gave all of you to my wellbeing. With each passing day, you gave enough commitment to see me going great. Just to let you know, I’m amazed by all you do and I can see that only a lifetime will be enough to thank you for all that you have done for me. I love you. I really do. I will forever do.";
                var lsm3 = "It’s been a good memory, each time I think of you. And then in my dreams comes a replay of your unabashed love, in rhythmical ways than words can tell. Each time I look at the morning sun, it reminds me of how your love shines in me. Each ray depicting the extent to which your care has gone in my soul. You continue to rock my world! Then when the breeze blows and I can’t tell from where it comes, I remember how difficult it’s been for me to get a grasp of your untold care for me. Your love has meant so much for me, it’s taken away all limitations. Your love has given enough reasons to know that true love exists. And when I sleep I night, I sigh, smile and sometimes would laugh… Because you’ve been all I needed in every single moment of the day and another day would come with you in it with me. You’ve made my love story sweet. You are sweet yourself and I see us going greatly each passing day. I love you for all you’ve done and are doing. I will forever appreciate your love. Thank you.";
                var lsm4 = "I was in a mental hell I had no hope of coming back from. I was in a daily mess I got no strength to come out of. I got a one-way ticket to a wasteful life, a long ride on the path to a journey of no return… Until I met you! I just couldn’t enjoy the rays from the sun, since all I saw was darkness hovering over my soul. The night times used to be worst, it’s when I would see all the anxieties of the world caving in on me… Until I met you! My life was a pack of mess, I was a prisoner of heartbreak, a lifer in the confines of bereavement and a subscriber of ceaseless dejection… Until I met you. Love truly meant nothing, life really worth nothing, the future always looked bleak and my past loss kept calling on me. There was nothing good that came to mind whenever I think of the world… Until I met you! And now see how you’ve turned me on, gave a ride to paradise! Look how you’ve gave a hope enough to anchor on forever. See how the sun reminds me of your love in my heart and the night stars and moon tells me of your ceaseless love and care! Now I wake up with the load of hope enough to activate the whole world and I sleep at night with no link to anxiety! Can You see how you’ve given all of you when I needed just a hand? Can you see how you’ve been the Angel that ported me from hell to heaven on earth? I love you… I so much love you.";
                var lsm5 = "Hey dear good morning, I just want to make some confessions to you sweets, you are the best things that ever happened to me, I just want to seize this opportunity to say thank you for loving me unconditionally and proving to me that there is still true love out there, you are one rare gem, and I am one hell of a lucky guy, I thank you for the laughs, the great times we have shared already(more still to come) you have changed my life totally, I can’t thank you enough, I just have to be the very best you want, you are my everything, I love you sweetest.";
                var lsm6 = "I am really happy having you in my life, you have given my life a new meaning , I knew I had some hiccups and bad times, but since you came everything is turning out pretty fine, you come with not just good love but also with good luck, you make my heart skip when I ‘m close to you, I am very happy when I get cute good morning text messages from you, I really look forward to those funny nicks you call me, I am super blessed having you in my life dear, I love you endlessly.";
                var lsm7 = "I know I always tell you I love you, honestly it isn’t enough, this I know, because those three words can’t really describe the way I feel about you, you give me butterflies when I kiss you, I have never been this attached to anyone, the love I have for you words cannot describe, I am really lost for words now, but know that you are everything to me, all I have ever wanted and even more, I love you so much my angel, you are my everything.";
                var lsm8 = " If you would see the way I see you, you would know feel the joy I get when we are together, I know you feel it too, but you would have to be me to understand my feelings for you better, baby I am crazy about you, the way I feel about you I doubt if there are any English words out there that could give me the exact explanation of my feelings.";
                var lsm9 = "From high school to dating and from being mere strangers to being love birds, my life has been so great with you, it’s been a joyride all through, I will love to step it up to the next level because you will make me the perfect wife. I feel so special to have known someone like you, I love you so much pretty.";
                var lsm10 = "Getting you out of my mind, it’s just impossible, whenever I try to think of something else I just can’t, when I close my eyes, it’s your beautiful face I see, I am so into you, and I am obsessed with you, and I know there are so many beautiful things to look forward to in our relationship, I am so happy I met you, you give me joy.";
                var lsm11 = "You are nothing short of glorious, you are perfect, and I don’t think I will ever get tired telling you, how beautiful you are, as you get old your beauty enhances, you make me happy always, you are quick to forgive my wrong doings, all the times I have spent with you is nothing short of awesome, I don’t think I can ever be grateful to you, but I will love you with all my heart, and never leave your side.";

I may not be there with you every minute of the day, But you’re always here with me in at least a thousand ways. Though I cannot really feel you here at my side, It’s always nice to know I’ve got these memories in my mind. I don’t need to see you to love you I only need to know you’re there. I don’t need to feel you I only need to know you care. Yey trying hard!!! Support nalang no love? 😅 Hi babe. Aaway naman 😦 I love you pa rin. Hihilo ako habang gagawa ko to wag ka na magalit. Happy 4th month mahal! Away hindi hiwalay. Alam natin yan. Gusto ko lang malaman mo na hinding hindi ako magsasawa sayo, satin, kahit anong mangyari.

Kahit sa simpleng paggising ko na nanjan ka parin, yun sobrang okay na ko dun. Salamat kasi hindi mo ko iniiwan (bawal) kahit gano ako kagago. Salamat kasi napaka understanding mo, totoo yan. Salamat kasi napapasaya mo ko lagi.. Salamat kasi mahal mo pa rin ako pagkatapos ng mga nangyari. Thank you kay Lord kasi binigay ka nya sakin. Syempre baby, sorry. For everything..
